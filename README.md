### Important terms

1. Keys
2. Satellite data
3. Record
4. Loop invariant

### Formal definition

Input: A sequence of n numbers <a1, a2, ..., an>. \
Output: A permutation (reordering) <a1', a2', ..., an'> of the input sequence such that a1' <= a2' <= ... <= an'.

### Available algorithms (not exhaustive)

### Factors for choosing a sorting algorithm

1. Number of items to be sorted
2. Extent to which items are already sorted
3. Restrictions on item values
4. Computer architecture and kind of storage device (e.g. main memory, disks, tapes, etc.)
